I'm Chris Henk. This is a new project of mine to expand on some of the discussions I
have on engineering and management topics. Forcing yourself to write down your position
refines it. Plus if my ideas are valid, they should stand up to scrutiny broadly and not
just in day to day conversations.

Why *Ghastly Propositions*? I love being facetious and deadpanning. When you state something that should be obvious but is considered a "hot take", it's the best framing.

I started programming in 7th grade without realizing it when my friend taught me how to program
our TI-84 calculators to automate our homework.
I got into programming more seriously in
high school writing a mix of mostly 2D games and [funny malware](https://github.com/LittleBoxOfSunshine/RickRollKeyboard) before getting my masters
in CS specializing in security and computer architecture.

There my research projects included devising exploits for the [DOMINO](https://www.usenix.org/legacy/publications/library/proceedings/mobisys04/pdf/p84-raya.pdf) protocol concept to steal bandwidth in IEEE 802.11 (WiFi) networks and creating designs for high performance arithmetic circuitry. You can view this legacy content on the [Long Form](/long-form) page. 

While I'll mostly focus on general topics, I'm sure that from time to time I'll dive into the more esoteric topics
I used to research. I've worked at companies ranging from startups to global enterprises as a security engineer and as a traditional software engineer.

My current day job is to build the foundation of the cloud. These days I'm most interested in
distributed systems, libraries, and bringing rigorous discipline to the software field
so that we may one day take our place along side the real engineers.
