I'm Chris Henk. This is a new project of mine to expand on some of the discussions I
have on engineering and management topics. Forcing yourself to write down you position
in a coherent, concise way refines it. Plus if my ideas truly are valid, well then they
should stand up to scrutiny broadly and not just in day to day conversations.

Why Ghastly Propositions? I love being facetious and dead panning. When you state something that should be obvious but is considered a "hot take", it's the best framing.

I got started programming without realizing it when my friend taught me how to program
our TI-84 calculators in 7th grade. We automated our algebra homework and would sell it to others for token amounts of money at lunch. I got into programming more seriously in
high school writing a mix of mostly 2D games and [funny malware](https://github.com/LittleBoxOfSunshine/RickRollKeyboard) before getting my masters
in CS specializing in security and computer architecture.

While I'll mostly focus on general topics, I'm sure I'll dive into more the esoteric topics
I used to research from time to time. I've worked at companies ranging from startups to global enterprises as a security engineer and as a traditional software engineer.

My current day job is to build the foundation of the cloud. These days I'm most interested in
distributed systems, libraries, and bringing rigorous discipline to the software field
so that we may one day take our place along side the real engineers.
