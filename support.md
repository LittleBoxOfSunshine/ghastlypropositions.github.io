Advertising is cancer. It's invasive, disruptive, and just generally annoying. This blog, along with the software products I create, always is and always will be proudly ad free.

I'm not expecting this blog to be a money making endeavor, and least not in the sense where the effective hourly rate will be anything to write home about (at time of writing, I've earned about $0.50/hr in profit!). Instead the goal is to refine and distribute ideas, save time by having a written document to refer people to, and to engage in discussion with others. The content here doesn't cost me anything to produce or host, but if you find it has value there are a couple of ways to support the work.

- Simply share it with others. It's cliche, but it's true. Particularly since as a reader you cost me nothing.
- Contribute to the open source projects I'm involved with or those that I promote here.
    - This includes the [blog](https://github.com/LittleBoxOfSunshine/ghastlypropositions.github.io) itself. It's all on GitHub. If you see a mistake, or wish to comment that's the place. My reach is small at the moment, but I'm also open to guest posts / linking to your original post if that ever changes. While I'd like to think I have some worthwhile ideas posted, I'm here to learn, not just to lecture.
- Use my affiliate links. I try not to go crazy with them. If they're included it's because they're genuinely related to the content. Not all posts have them for this reason. But, if you're looking for products I have a complete list of all affiliate links on this page.
- Jekyll template for GitHub pages to "leave a comment" that redirects to opening a new issue.

Thanks for reading the blog, and thanks for taking the time to inquire more about the behind the scenes!

## Implement It!

Looking for a side project? Open source or not, here are things I've found would add value to the world that are missing or I'm unaware of a good option for. Sometimes I've not even done basic research because I lack the time, so of these are probably low hanging fruit. Maybe this will evolve into a living page of recommended tools on the blog. Open an issue on the repo to make a recommendation.

<!-- [git blame misattribution]({% post_url 2024-02-07-git-blame-errors %}) -->
<!-- - A solution to git blame misattribution during refactoring changes -->
- An alternative to Google Analytics for basic tracking. I'm not a fan I have that link in there, but it was the easiest way to get page usage numbers.
- Automatic link aggregator by rule set (e.g. it'd be cool to generate the table of affiliates links below dynamically from the posts).
    - Ideally, you'd have a manifest to include metadata then reference it to generate links in both places. For example, the link text is different in a real sentence vs a list of products like on this page so you can't just blindly copy the link's text.
- A way to generate grouped affiliate links? Might violate ToS but maybe the product link goes to a page that lists the different retailers that sell it, and each item is an affiliate. That way you can increase conversions.

## Affiliate Links

This is updated over time. Sorting is best effort.
