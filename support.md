Advertising is cancer. It's invasive, disruptive, and just generally annoying. This blog, along with the software products I create, always is and always will be proudly ad free.

The content here doesn't cost me anything to produce or host, but if you find it has value there are a couple of ways to support the work!

- Simply share it with others. It's cliche, but it's true. Particularly since as a reader you cost me nothing.
- Contribute to the open source projects I'm involved with or those that I promote here.
- Use our affiliate links. I try not to go crazy with them. If they're included it's because they're genuinely related to the content. Not all posts have them for this reason. But, if you're looking for products I have a complete list of all affiliate links on this page.

Thanks for reading the blog, and thanks for taking the time to consider supporting further!
